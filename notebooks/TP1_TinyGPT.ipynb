        "- The MoE architecture represents a very effective approach to increase the performance of LLMs without increasing inference cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "- LLM outputs can be tuned with temperature, from 0 (zero) for deterministic output to values greater than 1 for more creative results. A good balance is typically achieved between 0.80 and 0.90.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Using top_p after top_k can be beneficial for bounding the output spectrum.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Hyperparameters like context_length and embedding dimension are very relevant for capturing sequential dependencies and producing grammatically meaningful outputs. Computational cost will increase as these values are raised."
